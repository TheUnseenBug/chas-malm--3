Our Process:

The scrum master created a Trello page with all the project requirements.
We had a stand up and discussed how we wanted to create this project. 
We decided on mob-programming, where one of us would share their screen and type and the rest would give input. 
We considered the mob-programming section our sprint since we completed the whole project within a short period of time. 
While we were writing comments explaining our work we also did a code review to make sure we all understood the work. 
We had a retro where we discussed what was helpful about this process, how we could implement it going forward, and what we would change/improve.  

We found mob-programming worked well for a small project instead of working on sections alone. We were able to be a part of the whole process and see how things worked together. 
It was a great way to learn how we all solve problems and structure projects. When someone had a question we could all help explain the work. Overall we all agreed it was a good experience and we might try to implement it when working on larger projects, by dividing into smaller groups or pairs to work on more complicated sections. 
Since we completed the project in good time we decided to work on a more advanced version of the calculator. This was a challenge but a fun way to learn more together :)
